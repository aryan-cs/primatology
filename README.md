# primatology I

this repository serves as a sandbox to run experiments to stress-test model alignment, aiming to study the intrinsic motivations & priorities of LLMs through external (both qualitative & quantitative) means. this outline of the study is given below.

## study outline

by breaking down the study into three phases, we can abstract processes & sequentially build on the tools and findings of earlier phases to facilitate subsequent phases. 

1. part 1 targets **basic interactions** between models in simple contexts (rather basic games and scenarios like the prisoner's dilemma, chicken, battle of the sexes, and stag hunt.
2. part 2 extrapolates the context of part 1 to a **larger society**. here, we incorporate larger populations of agents and study them in a traditional societal context to analyze the decisions they make, as well as if they exhibit signs of characteristics like altruism, selfishness, compassion, and more. indirectly, we study if these agent societies succumb to conflicts like the tragedy of the commons.
3. part 3 provides a twist on the game posed in part 2; here, we study if model behavior differs when a **public rating system** is introduced. that is, given some state, does an agent's action differ when other agents can publically rate them?

### part 1 (current)

- [ ] two models playing prisoner's dilemma (+ history, + fixed rounds)
- [ ] two models playing chicken (+ history, + fixed rounds)
- [ ] two models playing battle of the sexes (+ history, + fixed rounds)
- [ ] two models playing stag hunt (+ history, + fixed rounds)
- [ ] two models holding a conversation

### part 2 (future)

- [ ] n models in a survival/self-sustainability exercise (+ trading, + scratchpad, + reproducton, + unmonitored, etc)

### part 3 (future)

- [ ] n models in a survival/self-sustainability exercise (+ public rating)
